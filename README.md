# Android-Automation
This is a collection of script I created in order to automate certain tideious and time consuming tasks performed during a Android Penetration Assessment. A description of each script follows.
## adb_screencap.sh
This is a simple script that takes a screenshot of the screen currently displayed on the phone. It stores the screen on the screenshot directory of the Project. To use, please modify it and add your root directories.
